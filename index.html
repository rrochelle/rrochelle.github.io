   <h1>Rene Yarborough</h1>

	<p class="bio">I am the youngest of six and have been in IT for 20 years. I relocated to Chicago in 2010 to work for an aerospace company. I resigned from the aerospace company in 2013 and went to work for a pharma company back in IT. I love to travel and my favorite destination is the carribean. I have seven nieces and nephews and 3 great nieces and nephews. After spending three winters in Chicago I really understand why people live here... the summers on the lake. Warm weather, sandy beaches and blue water are my elements...... still here!</p>
